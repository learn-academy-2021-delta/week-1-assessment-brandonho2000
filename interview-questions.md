 Your answer: Pair programing is the act of programing with a parter, or partners that require the roles of a driver and navigator. the drivers job is to code while sharing their screen while the navigator leads the driver in the right direction while paying close attention and catching mistakes such as typos and punctuation mistakes.

  Researched answer: pair programing consists of two or more people sharing a document and working on it at the same time while only one is coding and the other navigates. the driver is the person actively coding while the navigator tells the driver what to do with the information.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  YYour answer: one thing we did this week that was helpful was the pair programing we did during the challenges. not only did it help us with pair programming and communication with out partners, but it gave us good practice for working on branches and github.
